Docker for Beginners - Linux
============================


In this lab, we will look at some basic Docker commands and a simple build-ship-run workflow. We’ll start by running some simple containers, then we’ll use a Dockerfile to build a custom app. Finally, we’ll look at how to use bind mounts to modify a running container as you might if you were actively developing using Docker.

Task 0: Prerequisites
---------------------

You will need all of the following to complete this lab:

*   A DockerID.  (from Docker Hub)
*   A clone of the lab’s GitHub repo.


### Make sure you have a DockerID

If you do not have a DockerID (a free login used to access Docker Hub), please visit [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com) and register for one. You will need this for later steps.

### Clone the Lab’s GitHub Repo

Use the following command to clone the lab’s repo from GitHub. This will make a copy of the lab’s repo in a new sub-directory called `linux_tweet_app`.

        git clone https://github.com/dockersamples/linux_tweet_app
    
Task 1: Run some simple Docker containers
-----------------------------------------

There are different ways to use containers. These include:

1.  **To run a single task:** This could be a shell script or a custom app.
2.  **Interactively:** This connects you to the container similar to the way you SSH into a remote server.
3.  **In the background:** For long-running services like website apps and databases.
4.  **Debug a broken container** Use the logs to figure out a problem.

In this section you’ll try each of those options and see how Docker manages the workload.

### Run a single task in an Alpine Linux container

In this step we’re going to start a new container and tell it to run the `hostname` command. The container will start, execute the `hostname` command, then exit.

1.  Run the following command in your Linux console.
    
         docker run alpine hostname
        
    
    The output below shows that the `alpine:latest` image could not be found locally. When this happens, Docker automatically _pulls_ it from Docker Hub.
    
    After the image is pulled, the container’s hostname is displayed (`888e89a3b36b` in the example below).
    
         Unable to find image 'alpine:latest' locally
         latest: Pulling from library/alpine
         88286f41530e: Pull complete
         Digest: sha256:f006ecbb824d87947d0b51ab8488634bf69fe4094959d935c0c103f4820a417d
         Status: Downloaded newer image for alpine:latest
         888e89a3b36b
        
    
2.  Docker keeps a container running as long as the process it started inside the container is still running. In this case the `hostname` process exits as soon as the output is written. This means the container stops. However, Docker doesn’t delete resources by default, so the container still exists in the `Exited` state.
    
    List all containers.
    
         docker ps --all
        
    
    Notice that your Alpine Linux container is in the `Exited` state.
    
         CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND             CREATED             STATUS            PORTS               NAMES
         888e89a3b36b        alpine              "hostname"          50 seconds ago      Exited (0) 49 seconds ago                       awesome_elion
        
    
    > **Note:** The container ID _is_ the hostname that the container displayed. In the example above it’s `888e89a3b36b`.
    

Containers which do one task and then exit can be very useful. You could build a Docker image that executes a script to configure something. Anyone can execute that task just by running the container - they don’t need the actual scripts or configuration information.

### Run an interactive Ubuntu container

In the previous step you ran a container based on a different version of Linux (Alpine) than is running on your Docker host (Ubuntu.)

In the next example, we are going to run an Ubuntu Linux container.

1.  Run a Docker container and access its shell.
    
         docker run --interactive --tty --rm ubuntu bash
        
    
    In this example, we’re giving Docker three parameters:
    
    *   `--interactive` says you want an interactive session. short form `-i`
    *   `--tty` allocates a pseudo-tty.  sort form `-t`
    *   `--rm` tells Docker to go ahead and remove the container when it’s done executing.
    
    The first two parameters allow you to interact with the Docker container.
    
    We’re also telling the container to run `bash` as its main process (PID 1).
    
    When the container starts you’ll drop into the bash shell with the default prompt `root@<container id>:/#`. Docker has attached to the shell in the container, relaying input and output between your local session and the shell session in the container.
    
2.  Run the following commands in the container.
    
    `ls /` will list the contents of the root director in the container, `ps aux` will show running processes in the container, `cat /etc/*release* and /etc/release` will show which Linux distro the container is running and a little more info, in this case Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (or later)
    
        ls /
        
        ps aux
        
        cat /etc/issue
        
        cat /etc/*release* 
        
    
3.  Type `exit` to leave the shell session. This will terminate the `bash` process, causing the container to exit.
    
         exit
        
    
    > **Note:** As we used the `--rm` flag when we started the container, Docker removed the container when it stopped. This means if you run another `docker ps --all` you won’t see the Ubuntu container.
    
4.  For fun, let’s check the version of our host VM.
    
         cat /etc/issue
        
    
    You should see:
    
         Ubuntu 24.04.4 LTS \n \l
        
    

Notice that our host VM is running Ubuntu and we are running Ubuntu container. As previously mentioned, the distribution of Linux inside the container does not need to match the distribution of Linux running on the Docker host.

However, Linux containers require the Docker host to be running a Linux kernel. For example, Linux containers cannot run directly on Windows Docker hosts. The same is true of Windows containers - they need to run on a Docker host with a Windows kernel.

Interactive containers are useful when you are putting together your own image. You can run a container and verify all the steps you need to deploy your app, and capture them in a Dockerfile.

> You _can_ [commit](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/commit/) a container to make an image from it - but you should avoid that wherever possible. It’s much better to use a repeatable [Dockerfile](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/) to build your image. You’ll see that shortly.

### Run a background MySQL container

Background containers are how you’ll run most applications. Here’s a simple example using MySQL.

1.  Run a new MySQL container with the following command.
    
         docker run \
         --detach \
         --name mydb \
         -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=my-secret-pw \
         mysql:latest
        
    
    *   `--detach` will run the container in the background.   short form `-d`
    *   `--name` will name it **mydb**.
    *   `-e` will use an environment variable to specify the root password (NOTE: This should never be done in production).
    
    As the MySQL image was not available locally, Docker automatically pulled it from Docker Hub.
    
         Unable to find image 'mysql:latest' locally
         latest: Pulling from library/mysql

    As long as the MySQL process is running, Docker will keep the container running in the background.
    
2.  List the running containers.
    
         docker ps
        
    
    Notice your container is running.
    
         CONTAINER ID   IMAGE          COMMAND                  CREATED              STATUS              PORTS                  NAMES

3.  You can check what’s happening in your containers by using a couple of built-in Docker commands: `docker container logs` and `docker container top`.
    
         docker logs mydb
        
    
    This shows the logs from the MySQL Docker container.

    Let’s look at the processes running inside the container.
    
           docker  top mydb
        
    
    You should see the MySQL daemon (`mysqld`) is running in the container.
    
         UID                 PID                 PPID                C                   STIME               TTY                 TIME                CMD
         systemd+            527105              527081              0                   10:55               ?                   00:00:01            mysqld
    
    Although MySQL is running, it is isolated within the container because no network ports have been published to the host. Network traffic cannot reach containers from the host unless ports are explicitly published.
    
4.  List the MySQL version using `docker exec`.
    
    `docker exec` allows you to run a command inside a container. In this example, we’ll use `docker exec` to run the command-line equivalent of `mysql --user=root --password=$MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD --version` inside our MySQL container.
    
         docker exec -it mydb \
         mysql --user=root --password=$MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD --version
        
    
    You will see the MySQL version number, as well as a handy warning.
    
          mysql: [Warning] Using a password on the command line interface can be insecure.
          mysql  Ver 8.0.24 for Linux on x86_64 (MySQL Community Server - GPL)
    
5.  You can also use `docker exec` to connect to a new shell process inside an already-running container. Executing the command below will give you an interactive shell (`sh`) inside your MySQL container.
    
         docker exec -it mydb sh
        
    
    Notice that your shell prompt has changed. This is because your shell is now connected to the `sh` process running inside of your container.
    
6.  Let’s check the version number by running the same command again, only this time from within the new shell session in the container.
    
         mysql --user=root --password=$MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD -h 127.0.0.1 -P 3306 --version
    
    You can use mysql to create your database interactively, (here you will be prompted for the password)
    
         mysql -u root -p   -h 127.0.0.1  -P 3306
                 
    
    Notice the output is the same as before.
    
7.  Type `exit` to leave the interactive shell session.
    
         exit
### Run a new background MySQL but this time make it accessable through the host:  

1. run `docker run --name mysql-container -d -e MYSQL_DATABASE=mydb -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=secret-password -e MYSQL_USER=dbuser -e MYSQL_PASSWORD=secret -p 3306:3306 mysql:latest`
   see [docker run](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/run/)
2. see the process `docker ps` and `sudo netstat -plan46 `  
   see [docker ps](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/ps/)
4. watch logs `docker logs mysql-container -f `  (the -f is like tail -f, to stdout & stderr continuously)  
   see [docker logs](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/logs/)
5. access it from the host:  `mysql -u root -p -h 127.0.0.1`  (while watching the logs, so open another terminal)

### Debug a broken container

In this step, we'll learn about how to debug containers that won't start, or otherwise have something wrong with them.

Normally, when you run a container of any type, docker will begin from the image's entrypoint. Frequently, this is a script of some kind.

Docker containers will generally run until the script at the entrypoint exits. Usually, this is after they've accomplished some useful task, or they've received some sort of signal.

However, in some instances, like, say, you're developing your own container, and you've made some sort of syntax error, the entrypoint script will exit immediately with a non-zero status code.

In order to debug what's wrong, we generally want to see the output the script we just ran; just like if we ran the script outside a container. We'd want to see what line the error we made was on,
or if there's any additional diagnostic information that may help us uncover what's happened.

1. Create a folder called `broken_container` in your home directory. Then `cd` into it.
2. In the directory, create the following two files, `script.py` and `Dockerfile`:

`script.py`

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python


x = 1
if x === 1:
    print("x is 1.")
```

and

`Dockerfile`

```
FROM python:3.13.0a6-slim-bookworm
COPY script.py script.py
CMD ["python", "script.py"]
```

3. Still in the `broken_container` directory, build, and run this container as a daemon by typing:

```
docker build . -t broken_container
docker run -d broken_container
```

Note that you'll receive a container id, but no output; this is because we're running the container as a daemon; and this is frequently how you'll run apps that you build.

4. Try to find your running container, using `docker ps`. Note that the container isn't listed! Why? Because this container's entrypoint contains a syntax error, and has already exited.
Try running the command that shows *all* containers, including those that have exited (log hint: screenshot your list of stopped containers).

5. Once you've located your stopped container, try pulling the logs for that container, with `docker logs <container id>`.

6. You should see the error in the above script. (log hint: screenshot). Fix the syntax error, and then rebuild your image, and try running a new container.

7. This time, the container will have still exited, but it should now have exited successfully with status 0. Pull the logs for the container again, and then note down the output. (log hint: screenshot)


Task 2: Package and run a custom app using Docker
-------------------------------------------------

In this step you’ll learn how to package your own apps as Docker images using a [Dockerfile](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/).

The Dockerfile syntax is straightforward. In this task, we’re going to create a simple NGINX website from a Dockerfile.

### Build a simple website image

Let’s have a look at the Dockerfile we’ll be using, which builds a simple website that allows you to send a tweet.

1.  Make sure you’re in the `linux_tweet_app` directory.
    
         cd ~/linux_tweet_app
        
    
2.  Display the contents of the Dockerfile.  (note the DocumentRoot for nginx is `/usr/share/nginx/html/`)
    `
         cat Dockerfile
        
    
         FROM nginx:latest
        
         COPY index.html /usr/share/nginx/html
         COPY linux.png /usr/share/nginx/html
        
         EXPOSE 80 443     
        
         CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
        
    
    Let’s see what each of these lines in the Dockerfile do.
    
    *   [FROM](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#from) specifies the base image to use as the starting point for this new image you’re creating. For this example we’re starting from `nginx:latest`.
    *   [COPY](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#copy) copies files from the Docker host into the image, at a known location. In this example, `COPY` is used to copy two files into the image: `index.html`. and a graphic that will be used on our webpage.
    *   [EXPOSE](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#expose) documents which ports the application uses.
    *   [CMD](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#cmd) specifies what command to run when a container is started from the image. Notice that we can specify the command, as well as run-time arguments.
3.  In order to make the following commands more copy/paste friendly, export an environment variable containing your DockerID (if you don’t have a DockerID you can get one for free via [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com)).
    
    You will have to manually type this command as it requires your unique DockerID.
    
    `export DOCKERID=<your docker id>`
    
4.  Echo the value of the variable back to the terminal to ensure it was stored correctly.
    
         echo $DOCKERID
        
    
5.  Use the `docker build` command to create a new Docker image using the instructions in the Dockerfile.
    
    *   `--tag` allows us to give the image a custom name. In this case it’s comprised of our DockerID, the application name, and a version. Having the Docker ID attached to the name will allow us to store it on Docker Hub in a later step
    *   `.` tells Docker to use the current directory as the build context
    
    Be sure to include period (`.`) at the end of the command.
    
         docker build --tag $DOCKERID/linux_tweet_app:1.0 .
        
    
    The output below shows the Docker daemon executing each line in the Dockerfile
    
         Sending build context to Docker daemon  32.77kB

         Successfully tagged <your docker ID>/linux_tweet_app:latest
        
    
6.  Use the `docker run` command to start a new container from the image you created.
    
    As this container will be running an NGINX web server, we’ll use the `--publish` flag to publish port 80 inside the container onto port 80 on the host. This will allow traffic coming in to the Docker host on port 80 to be directed to port 8123 (choose an unused port on your VM) in the container. The format of the `--publish` flag is `host_port`:`container_port`.
    
         docker run \
         --detach \
         --publish 8123:80 \
         --name linux_tweet_app \
         $DOCKERID/linux_tweet_app:1.0
        
    
   In this example, we’re giving Docker three parameters:
    
    *   `--detach` swill run the container in the background. short form `-d`
    *   `--publish  host-port: container-por` will forward the container-port to the host-port.  sort form `-p`
    *   `--rm` tells Docker to go ahead and remove the container when it’s done executing.
    
    Any external traffic coming into the server on port 8123 will now be directed into the container on port 80.
    
    In a later step you will see how to map traffic from two different ports - this is necessary when two containers use the same port to communicate since you can only expose the port once on the host.
    
7.  You can load the website with http://127.0.0.1:8123 (unless you used another port) which should be running.  To access it outside your VM open the port on the firewall.
    
8.  Once you’ve accessed your website, shut it down and remove it.
    
         docker  rm --force linux_tweet_app
        
    
    > **Note:** We used the `--force` or `-f` parameter to remove the running container without shutting it down. This will ungracefully shutdown the container and permanently remove it from the Docker host.
    > 
    > In a production environment you may want to use `docker stop` to gracefully stop the container and leave it on the host. You can then use `docker container rm` to permanently remove it.
    

Task 3: Modify a running website
--------------------------------

When you’re actively working on an application it is inconvenient to have to stop the container, rebuild the image, and run a new version every time you make a change to your source code.

One way to streamline this process is to mount the source code directory on the local machine into the running container. This will allow any changes made to the files on the host to be immediately reflected in the container.

We do this using something called a [bind mount](https://docs.docker.com/engine/admin/volumes/bind-mounts/).

When you use a bind mount, a file or directory on the host machine is mounted into a container running on the same host.

### Start our web app with a bind mount

1.  Let’s start the web app and mount the current directory into the container.
    
    In this example we’ll use the `--mount` flag to mount the current directory on the host into `/usr/share/nginx/html` inside the container.
    
    Be sure to run this command from within the `linux_tweet_app` directory on your Docker host.
    
         docker run \
         --detach \
         --publish 8123:80 \
         --name linux_tweet_app \
         --mount type=bind,source="$(pwd)",target=/usr/share/nginx/html \
         $DOCKERID/linux_tweet_app:1.0
        
    
    > Remember from the Dockerfile, `/usr/share/nginx/html` is where the html files are stored for the web app.
    
2.  The http://127.0.0.1:8123 (or whatever port you choose instead of 8123) should be running.
3.  Using the website for docker describe what this is doing `--mount type=bind,source="$(pwd)",target=/usr/share/nginx/html` in your log.
    

### Modify the running website

Bind mounts mean that any changes made to the local file system are immediately reflected in the running container. 
In your command you bind the current working directory `$(pwd)`  which should be `~/linux_tweet_app` on the host to `/usr/share/nginx/html` on the container so that any changes made 
to  your current working directory are reflected in the container

1.  On your VM Edit (use `vi`)  `index.html` add a `<h2>`  with your name(s)  and reload the container app via your browser, http://127.0.0.1:8123 (or whatever port you choose instead of 8123) should be running. you will see the changes.  
<!--
> If you are comfortable with `vi` you can use it to load the local `index.html` file and make additional changes. Those too would be reflected when you reload the webpage. 
-->
If you are really adventurous, why not try using `exec` to access the running container and modify the files stored there.

3.  Copy a new `index.html` into the container.
    
    The Git repo that you pulled earlier contains several different versions of an index.html file. You can manually run an `ls` command from within the `~/linux_tweet_app` directory to see a list of them. In this step we’ll replace `index.html` with `index-new.html`.
    
         cp index-new.html index.html
        
    
2.  Go to the running http://127.0.0.1:8123 or (chosen port) and **refresh the page**. Notice that the site has changed.

Even though we’ve modified the `index.html` local filesystem and seen it reflected in the running container, we’ve not actually changed the Docker image that the container was started from.

To show this, stop the current container and re-run the `1.0` image without a bind mount.

1.  Stop and remove the currently running container.
    
         docker rm --force linux_tweet_app
        
    
2.  Rerun the current version without a bind mount.
    
         docker run \
         --detach \
         --publish 8123:80 \
         --name linux_tweet_app \
         $DOCKERID/linux_tweet_app:1.0
        
    
3.  Notice the http://127.0.0.1:8123 (or chosen port) is back to the original version.
    
4.  Stop and remove the current container
    
        docker rm --force linux_tweet_app
        
    

### Update the image

To persist the changes you made to the `index.html` file into the image, you need to build a new version of the image.

1.  Build a new image and tag it as `2.0`
    
    Remember that you previously modified the `index.html` file on the Docker hosts local filesystem. This means that running another `docker build` command will build a new image with the updated `index.html`
    
    Be sure to include the period (`.`) at the end of the command.
    
         docker build --tag $DOCKERID/linux_tweet_app:2.0 .
        
    
    Notice how fast that built! This is because Docker only modified the portion of the image that changed vs. rebuilding the whole image.
    
2.  Let’s look at the images on the system.
    
         docker images
        
    
    You now have both versions of the web app on your host.
    
         REPOSITORY                     TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE
         <docker id>/linux_tweet_app    2.0                 01612e05312b        16 seconds ago      108MB
         <docker id>/linux_tweet_app    1.0                 bb32b5783cd3        4 minutes ago       108MB
         mysql                          latest              b4e78b89bcf3        2 weeks ago         412MB
         ubuntu                         latest              2d696327ab2e        2 weeks ago         122MB
         nginx                          latest              da5939581ac8        3 weeks ago         108MB
         alpine                         latest              76da55c8019d        3 weeks ago         3.97MB
        
    

### Test the new version

1.  Run a new container from the new version of the image.
    
         docker run \
         --detach \
         --publish 8123:80 \
         --name linux_tweet_app \
         $DOCKERID/linux_tweet_app:2.0
        
    
2.  Check the new version of the website use your url http://127.0.0.1:8123 (or chosen port) (**You may need to refresh your browser to get the new version to load**).
    
    The web page will have an orange background.
    
    We can run both versions side by side. The only thing we need to be aware of is that we cannot have two containers using port 80 on the same host.
    
    As we’re already using port 8123 for the container running from the `2.0` version of the image, we will start a new container and publish it on port 8080. Additionally, we need to give our container a unique name (`old_linux_tweet_app`)
    
3.  Run another new container, this time from the old version of the image.
    
    Notice that this command maps the new container to port 8080 on the host. This is because two containers cannot map to the same port on a single Docker host.
    
         docker run \
         --detach \
         --publish 8080:80 \
         --name old_linux_tweet_app \
         $DOCKERID/linux_tweet_app:1.0
        
    
4.  View the old version of the website via  http://127.0.0.1:8080 or (chosen port)
    

### Push your images to Docker Hub

1.  List the images on your Docker host.
    
         docker images -f reference="$DOCKERID/*"
        
    
    You will see that you now have two `linux_tweet_app` images - one tagged as `1.0` and the other as `2.0`.
    
         REPOSITORY                     TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE
         <docker id>/linux_tweet_app    2.0                 01612e05312b        3 minutes ago       108MB
         <docker id>/linux_tweet_app    1.0                 bb32b5783cd3        7 minutes ago       108MB
        
    
    These images are only stored in your Docker hosts local repository. Your Docker host will be deleted after the workshop. In this step we’ll push the images to a public repository so you can run them from any Linux machine with Docker.
    
    Distribution is built into the Docker platform. You can build images locally and push them to a public or private [registry](https://docs.docker.com/registry/), making them available to other users. Anyone with access can pull that image and run a container from it. The behavior of the app in the container will be the same for everyone, because the image contains the fully-configured app - the only requirements to run it are Linux and Docker.
    
    [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com) is the default public registry for Docker images.
    
2.  Before you can push your images, you will need to log into Docker Hub.
    
         docker login
        
    
    You will need to supply your Docker ID credentials when prompted.
    
         Username: <your docker id>
         Password: <your docker id password>
         Login Succeeded
        
    
3.  Push version `1.0` of your web app using `docker image push`.
    
         docker image push $DOCKERID/linux_tweet_app:1.0
        
    
    You’ll see the progress as the image is pushed up to Docker Hub.
    
         The push refers to a repository [docker.io/<your docker id>/linux_tweet_app]
         910e84bcef7a: Pushed
         1dee161c8ba4: Pushed
         110566462efa: Pushed
         305e2b6ef454: Pushed
         24e065a5f328: Pushed
         1.0: digest: sha256:51e937ec18c7757879722f15fa1044cbfbf2f6b7eaeeb578c7c352baba9aa6dc size: 1363
        
    
4.  Now push version `2.0`.
    
         docker image push $DOCKERID/linux_tweet_app:2.0
        
    
    Notice that several lines of the output say `Layer already exists`. This is because Docker will leverage read-only layers that are the same as any previously uploaded image layers.
    
         The push refers to a repository [docker.io/<your docker id>/linux_tweet_app]
         0b171f8fbe22: Pushed
         70d38c767c00: Pushed
         110566462efa: Layer already exists
         305e2b6ef454: Layer already exists
         24e065a5f328: Layer already exists

You can browse to `https://hub.docker.com/r/<your docker id>/` and see your newly-pushed Docker images. These are public repositories, so anyone can pull the image - you don’t even need a Docker ID to pull public images. Docker Hub also supports private repositories.
